            <h2>Together and individually I will work toward radical change from the inside out&hellip;</h2>
            
            <h3>I will work toward noticing the blessings and privileges of my life each day.</h3>
            <p>Because it is radical to maintain loving and abundant open thought amid oppression and struggle.</p>
            
            <h3>I will express grief knowing that I can trust you with it.</h3>
            <p>Because it is a radical act to feel, in a world that asks we carry so much. Because it is radical to never forget those who have passed.</p>
            
            <h3>I will reach out for support and trust the act of truth-telling.</h3>
            <p>Because it is resilient to face myself in my darkest moments and still continue to have a voice.</p>
            
            <h3>I will teach myself how to view my own reflection with positive intention and focus on an open, honest outlook.</h3>
            <p>Because it is radical to find joy in everything I do, my strengths and imperfections, to find love for myself and challenge internalized voices of oppression.</p>
            
            <h3>I will remember that I carry strength and draw from generations of resilient working women.</h3>
            <p>Because it is revolutionary. Because it is essential and fundamental to recall history and honor past, forgotten, and even living, spirits that plead for change.</p>
            
            <h3>I will remember that my sense of caring comes from generations of men who were brave enough to show love.</h3>
            <p>Because it is strong to express caring when the world tells you that it is weak.</p>
            
            <h3>I will keep my families in my heart, whatever shape or form they take.</h3>
            <p>Because only together can we struggle against oppression and thrive.</p>
            
            <h3>I will express support for relationships that do not yet have a name.</h3>
            <p>Because relationships find their own truth and reason for being.</p>
