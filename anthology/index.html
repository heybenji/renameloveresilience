                We're Amelia Ortega and Benji Mauer. We met 19 years years ago, and over the years have come to think of each other as platonic life partners and family. Nine years ago we made the decision to publicly acknowledge our relationship in a community event of love and commitment titled “Rename Love Resilience.” ( link to commitment statement is below)
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe that relationships find their own truth and reason for being. As we approach our 20 year anniversary, we'd like to gather people again. This time, we're seeking narratives, encounters, memories, artifacts, photographs, and creative works about platonic life partnerships, best friends, queer family, commitments formed outside of traditional marriages.
            </p>

            <p>
                We are seeking a diverse body of contributions to this anthology on Platonic Life Partnership and chosen families.  Queer families and chosen families are a function of survival, of generational commitment, of social and cultural place making.  We welcome you to contribute creative works that speak to the ways in which love, connection, family and platonic partnership have touched your life.  
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This anthology will serve as an archive for relationships that once were, that continue to be, that are seeking to become.   
            </p>
